				<h1>About me</h1>

				<p>
					I am a hobbyist programmer.
					I am able to code in Python and Java, and I am able to do some basic web development.
					I am also currently learning GoLang. I am moderately familiar with working with REST APIs.
					I also have some experience working with discord.py, a wrapper for creating Discord bots.
					I have an interest in cryptography, and I have a basic understanding of cryptography and related systems.
					I enjoy mathematics and physics.
					I also make music with <a href="https://beepbox.co/">Beepbox</a> and <a href="https://jummbus.bitbucket.io/">Jummbox</a>, and my music can be found on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pyth23/">Soundcloud</a>.

				<h2>Yenigma</h2>
				<p>
					The Yenigma is an encryption scheme that I created, based on the Enigma, a German encryption machine used in World War II.
					The Yenigma was made based on the Enigma, but fixes some of its major shortcomings.
					For example, the Yenigma incorporates the plugboard of the Enigma into the rotation of the rotors, making it much harder to ignore it as a simple substitution cipher.
					The one major downside compared to the original Enigma is that unlike the Enigma, the Yenigma requires the intent (encrypt/decrypt) to be specified.
