                <p>
                    I am a hobbyist programmer.
                    I am able to code in <span>Python</span> and <span>Java</span>, and I am able to do some basic <span>web development</span>.
                    I am also currently learning <span>GoLang</span>. I am moderately familiar with working with <span>REST API</span>s.
                    I also have some experience working with <span>discord.py</span>, a wrapper for creating <span>Discord bots</span>.
                    I have an interest in <span>cryptography</span>, and I have a basic understanding of <span>cryptography</span> and related systems.
                    I enjoy <span>mathematics</span> and <span>physics</span>.
                    I also make music with <a href="https://beepbox.co/"><span>Beepbox</span></a> and <a href="https://jummbus.bitbucket.io/"><span>Jummbox</span></a>, and my music can be found on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pyth23/"><span>Soundcloud</span></a>.

                <h1>My projects</h1>

                <h2>Yenigma</h2>
                <p>
                    The <span>Yenigma</span> is an encryption scheme that I created, based on the <span>Enigma</span>, a German encryption machine used in World War II.
                    The <span>Yenigma</span> was made based on the <span>Enigma</span>, but fixes some of its major shortcomings.
                    For example, the <span>Yenigma</span> incorporates the plugboard of the <span>Enigma</span> into the rotation of the rotors, making it much harder to ignore it as a simple <span>substitution cipher</span>.
                    The one major downside compared to the original <span>Enigma</span> is that unlike the <span>Enigma</span>, the <span>Yenigma</span> requires the intent (encrypt/decrypt) to be specified.
